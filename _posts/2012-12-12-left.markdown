Left is a clean, whitespace-happy layout for [Jekyll][jekyll].

This is designed to be an easy layout to modify for your own blog. It was
extracted from [zachholman.com][zh], which means it was battle-hardened from
years of posting serious blog posts about emoji and swear words.

You're actually reading an example post right now. See how cool it is? Oh, be
quiet, you're making me blush.

You'll want to [get the code][left] and read the README to learn how to
install and set up Left for your own purposes.

If you have any questions, follow and ping me on Twitter- I'm

  <p>Nevada Dynamics is enabling companies and researchers to take advantage of drones by removing both technical and regulatory barriers. Currently, any company that wants to send a drone across a city runs into many problems, including obstacle avoidance, adherence to local and national laws, long distance monitoring, and expensive pilots. By connecting drones to the internet, Nevada Dynamics provides the technology infrastructure to integrate existing drone systems into a safe, commercial environment, where drones can be sent anywhere with the click of a button or swipe of a finger. </p>

 

	<h2>What comes with Totem and Nevada Dynamics </h2>

	<p>Our system can be installed on a drone using an onboard Android cell phone (with our Totem app) or small Linux computer (running Totem software), connecting to the internet through a Drone Data Plan that we provide though strategic partnerships with cellular carriers, and operating with low-latency, encrypted, lightweight messages. The control client can then be run from any web browser, mobile or desktop. This enables drones to be sent anywhere to film anything, deliver any package, monitor any security perimeter, or anything else imaginable.</p>


	<p>The cloud connectivity; however, is simply a means to an end, as we enable the drones themselves to create custom flight plans that avoid buildings, other aircraft, and no-fly zones, while integrating with the national Unmanned Traffic Management system currently being developed by NASA and the FAA. Nevada Dynamics believes that controlling drones should be simple and intuitive, not complicated and filled with regulatory compliance training. Companies, hobbyists, and governments can use drones for their true purpose, and leave the flying to us.</p>


	<p>By moving the common "ground control station" to the cloud, Nevada Dynamics has eliminated complexity and enabled any company to navigate this new market and use drones to their maximum potential, in the absolute easiest way possible by directly using our web control station, contracting with us to build specific drone applications, or by taking advantage of our open API and building on top of our system. This platform can move in many different directions, and we look forward to adding to our list of collaborators, which currently includes universities, large international and domestic drone and autopilot manufacturers, UAS-service based companies, national cellular networks, and state governments.</p>


  <h2>Starting from the Biggest Little City in the World!</h2>
  <p>Nevada Dynamics began in the summer of 2014 in a garage near the University of Nevada in Reno. While brainstorming ideas for senior projects, founders MacCallister Higgins (Computer Science and Engineering) and Erik Edgington (Mechanical Engineering) came up with the idea to do a combined mechanical and computer science capstone project. Due to mechanical and programming complexities, a project involving UAVs became the frontrunner. While many senior projects are sponsored by an outside company or suggested by the university, the team that would become Nevada Dynamics knew that they wanted their senior projects to embody the roots of a viable, standalone business. The core team was assembled, the field selected, but the problem Nevada Dynamics set out to solve was undefined.</p>
  <p>The evolution in control theory gave birth to the rapidly expanding field of UAVs. From research and prior industry experience, Nevada Dynamics realized the development of stabilization control systems and UAV hardware would be a losing proposition, as it would be near impossible to catch industry leaders with more time, money, and experience. To be successful, the team aimed to put itself in a position to solve a problem that all future UAV hobbyists and companies alike would have to deal with, and one that MacCallister had encountered while working with the UNR Robotics group: Long range command and control.</p>
  <p>What started off as a senior project has since evolved substantially to get the point Nevada Dynamics is at today.</p>

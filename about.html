  <p>Nevada Dynamics has designed a system that is capable of  monitoring and controlling all UAV aircraft in civilian airspace. In doing so, it aims to have an incredible impact on the social nature of our society, as the widespread use of UAVs is enabled in a safe, effective, and optimal manner.  Similar to the internet, Nevada Dynamics looks to break the complexities involved down into layers so that any business, large or small, can use our network. You do not need to know the complexities of the TCP protocol to send a Facebook message, and you will not need to understand GPS telemetry or FAA flight path protocols to start a flower delivery business or defibrillator ambulance UAV service. By solving these problems, Nevada Dynamics intends to provide the metaphorical Gold Rush shovel, and consequently enable the overall market to flourish. </p>

  <h2>Starting from the Biggest Little City in the World!</h2>
  <p>Nevada Dynamics began in the summer of 2014 in a garage near the University of Nevada in Reno. While brainstorming ideas for senior projects, founders MacCallister Higgins (Computer Science and Engineering) and Erik Edgington (Mechanical Engineering) came up with the idea to do a combined mechanical and computer science capstone project. Due to mechanical and programming complexities, a project involving UAVs became the frontrunner. While many senior projects are sponsored by an outside company or suggested by the university, the team that would become Nevada Dynamics knew that they wanted their senior projects to embody the roots of a viable, standalone business. The core team was assembled, the field selected, but the problem Nevada Dynamics set out to solve was undefined.</p>
  <p>The evolution in control theory gave birth to the rapidly expanding field of UAVs. From research and prior industry experience, Nevada Dynamics realized the development of stabilization control systems and UAV hardware would be a losing proposition, as it would be near impossible to catch industry leaders with more time, money, and experience. To be successful, the team aimed to put itself in a position to solve a problem that all future UAV hobbyists and companies alike would have to deal with, and one that MacCallister had encountered while working with the UNR Robotics group: Long range command and control.</p>
  <p>What started off as a senior project has since evolved substantially to get the point Nevada Dynamics is at today.</p>
  
  <h2>The Future</h2>
  <p>Nevada Dynamics is currently transitioning from a research and development capacity to unveiling the first product line. (Spoiler alert: it involves drones)</p>

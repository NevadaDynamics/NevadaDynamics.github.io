<h2>What NVD Does</h2>
<p>Currently, any company that wants to send a drone across a city runs into many problems, including obstacle avoidance, adherence to local and national laws, long distance monitoring, and expensive pilots. By connecting drones to the internet, Nevada Dynamics provides the technology infrastructure to integrate existing drone systems into a safe, commercial environment, where drones can be sent anywhere with the click of a button or swipe of a finger, and data can be immediately uploaded and visualized. NVD got started in a garage with some students just over a year ago, and we have made some incredible progress towards making this vision a reality.</p>

<p>The NVD system can be installed on a drone using an onboard Android cell phone (with our Totem app) or small Linux computer (running Totem software), connecting to the internet through a Drone Data Plan that we provide though strategic partnerships with cellular carriers, and operating with low-latency, encrypted, lightweight messages. If you check out the picture at the top of this page, you can just barely see the profile of an Android phone mounted on the bottom of the 3DR Iris, running our current app. The control client can then be run from any web browser, mobile or desktop. This enables drones to be sent anywhere to film anything, deliver any package, monitor any security perimeter, or anything else imaginable. As a bonus, we are also supporting real-time video streaming straight from the drone over cellular networks.</p>

<p>The cloud connectivity; however, is simply a means to an end, as we enable the drones themselves to create custom flight plans that avoid buildings, other aircraft, and no-fly zones, while integrating with the national Unmanned Traffic Management system currently being developed by NASA and the FAA. Nevada Dynamics believes that controlling drones should be simple and intuitive, not complicated and filled with regulatory compliance training.</p>

<br>
<p>Drones are currently mostly used for filming, and producing professional drone footage requires professional drone operators that can cost over 15k a day. For small, independent filmakers, this is not an option. Using the 3D database that we are developing and expanding with every drone flight on our system, planning cinematic shots will soon be as easy as point-and-click. NVD is currently testing our 3D visualization engine, which will allow our users to plan paths visually in 3D space, setting up shots like a true director. The coolest part? This feature will hook right into commercial VR headsets and Android applications, leading to a truly immersive experience that puts you right behind the camera. This feature will be rolled into our beta, which officially launches February 20th.</p>

<p>By moving the common "ground control station" to the cloud, Nevada Dynamics has eliminated complexity and enabled any company to navigate this new market and use drones to their maximum potential, in the absolute easiest way possible by directly using our web control station, contracting with us to build specific drone applications, or by taking advantage of our open API and building on top of our system. This platform can move in many different directions, and we look forward to adding to our list of collaborators, which currently includes universities, large international and domestic drone and autopilot manufacturers, UAS-service based companies, and national cellular networks.</p>

<h2>What NVD can do with Tango</h2>
<p>Our vision extends beyond just enabling filming for the average consumer or easy drone integration into businesses. Our development timeline includes layering real-time video over our 3D terrain database, and visualizing that over the browser for our users. This, paired with our path planning, would allow one operator to monitor a large area with several drones, with no need for pilots or multiple people viewing multiple video streams. This, based on our customer interviews, would enable a large subset of use cases of drones to finally become a scalable reality. By removing all the technical barriers to entry, NVD wants to truly unlock the potential of drones and enable the future of things that fly.</p>
<p>These long term goals of NVD require a few more things, namely some advanced localization, accurate pose estimation, and real-time close range modeling. Sound familiar? We purchased the Tango dev kit the day we were invited into the beta, and have been exploring its potential ever since. We would love to work directly with Google in using Tango, onboard our aircraft, to utilize SLAM to figure out where we are, and more importantly, what we are looking at. The sensor fusion possibilities are also incredibly intriguing to our team, and bringing in GPS to the current IMU/Visual odometry pairing could prove to produce some amazing results, right on the Android device. For any drone to operate in an urban environment with buildings, people, and other generally unknown obstacles, we need to take in all of the information we can get.</p>
<p>We initially chose to launch our initial product using an Android application for a few key reasons: Small footprint, built-in cellular radio, and an OS with battery life and security considerations baked in. For these same reasons, we would love to stick with Android as we move beyond a priori command and control, and into the domain of real-time sensing and localization. The Android OS has already allowed us to do so much with such a small team, and we want to continue utilizing all of these benefits as we move beyone our beta into the next level of navigation. We've been impressed with what we have been able to do with the Tango device so far, and a partnership in the app incubator would give us not only the resources to augment our current application, but demonstrate much needed industry support as we move ahead in our business and technical development timeline.</p>

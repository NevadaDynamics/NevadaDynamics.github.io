					<h3>MacCallister Higgins</h3>
					<h4>CEO</h4>
					<p>MacCallister J. S. Higgins collegiate career encompassed Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno. He has worked at the Polymer Microsystems (PlUS) Lab under Dr. Geiger since 2011 developing lab technologies, fabricating equipment, researching microfluidic methodologies, and assisting in several other projects with both masters and undergraduate students. Having worked on projects for the NASA OMEGA System (designed and built an autonomous mesh network of sensors) and in support of various other grants through the PlUS Lab, he was awarded the Undergraduate Research Award to pursue the development of an on-demand, direct-write microfluidic fabrication system. Currently, he is also doing research in the field of Human-Robot Interaction as well as the large-scale control of Unmanned Autonomous Systems for the UNR Robotics group, including failure contingencies and safety systems in the event of a catastrophic motor failure on rotorcraft UAVs.
